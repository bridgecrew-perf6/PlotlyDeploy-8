# Improbable Beef and Belly Buttons...*who knew?*

## Background
Roza, a researcher working with Improbable Beef, a food company looking for meat alternatives, has a hypothesis that the human belly button is the ideal breeding ground for the type bacteria to synthesize such alternatives.  

Roza has collected bacteria samples from hundrerds of volunteers and has assembled a great deal of data on these subjects and has a partially completed dashboard that needs some work. With a drop-down menu filtering Subject ID number and the resulting panel of demographic information in place, now some visualization is needed to illustrate the bacterial data for each volunteer. 

## Objective
The objectivs of this exercise is to add 3 graphs and improve the current formatting.  More specifically,

1. **Bar graph**: depict the top 10 bacterial species found in the belly buttons of the volunteers; this enables Improbably Beef to easily see if a volunteer has the 
2. **Gauge graph**: highlighting the numbers of times per week the volunteer washes their navel; frequency has impact on bacteria.
3. **Bubble Graph**: graphically showing the presence of all the bacteria for the selected subject.  The size of the bubbles varies based on much of each bacteria type was found. 


## Process
### Resources:
This process involves using the following tools:

*  **JavaScript** for the script coding implementing the Data-Driven Documents (**D3.js**) and **Plotly** library to allow for more streamlined code and formatting.

*  **HTML** for the web deisgn implementing **Bootstrap 3** elements and **CSS** styling.
